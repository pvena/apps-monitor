  abstract = {The paper presents a system level design approach to power optimization
	in mobile/wearable computers. The paper identifies the major components
	of power consumption in a mobile system, and evaluates their respective
	contributions to power consumption, focusing on the impact of wireless
	networking. An experimental evaluation of several techniques for
	improving energy efficiency of a mobile system is presented},

  title = {Energy efficiency of mobile clients in cloud computing},
  year = {2010},
  pages = {4-4},
  abstract = {Energy efficiency is a fundamental consideration for mobile devices.
	Cloud computing has the potential to save mobile client energy but
	the savings from offloading the computation need to exceed the energy
	cost of the additional communication.
	
	
	In this paper we provide an analysis of the critical factors affecting
	the energy consumption of mobile clients in cloud computing. Further,
	we present our measurements about the central characteristics of
	contemporary mobile handheld devices that define the basic balance
	between local and remote computing. We also describe a concrete example,
	which demonstrates energy savings.
	
	
	We show that the trade-offs are highly sensitive to the exact characteristics
	of the workload, data communication patterns and technologies used,
	and discuss the implications for the design and engineering of energy
	efficient mobile cloud computing solutions.},
